              the final project for Enspiral Dev Academy. The class was
              segmented into groups, and each group had a week to build a
              application for presentation. Our group that consisted of Alex,
              Nat, Arpo, Ranjit and myself worked on differing aspects of the
              project. At the beginning we assigned the components of the
              project based on the skills that people were not confident in.
              Through doing this we were required to focus on Agile based
              techniques in keeping up with tasks.

            <p>
              Worked on an individual project during Enspiral. The project was
              completed outside of class hours and was fundamental in helping us
              acknowledge our own strengths and weaknesses. My plan was to
              create a reading diary, wherein the user could follow their
              reading progress, what books they wanted to read, what books they
              were reading, etc. To do this I attempted to use the GoodReads API
              and use the data so the user could access numerous books. I was
              unable to access the API and was forced to settle for another API
              with less data.
            </p>

            <h4>WHAT I LEARNT WORKING ON THE PROJECT</h4>
            <p className={homeStyles.lists}>
              1. Self-Discipline in working independently on an individual
              project.
            </p>
            <p>2. Organising, planning, and time managment. </p>
            <p>
              3. The fundamental thing I learnt working on the project, was
              recognising my own abilities, what I'm best at and what I need to
              work on.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. In using external API's, you rely heavily on the organisation
              providing the API. In attempting to use the GoodReads API, I
              failed in that there wasn't much incentive for them to give out
              the data they have. This made it almost impossible to get.
